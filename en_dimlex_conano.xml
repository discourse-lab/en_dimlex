Mazda has the Bongo truck and, under its Autozam nameplate, a "microvan" called the Scrum. Its buglike Carol minicar is "designed with softness, gentleness and warmheartedness."  But the court jester appears to be Japan's smallest car maker, Daihatsu Motor Co. One of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike Sneaker, which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear. Daihatsu also has the Fellow 90, the Leeza Spider and the Hijet Dumbo.  The jokes aren't just on the Japanese, though</example>

        <example>The government and the ANC, the bitterest of enemies, are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table. Pretoria releases the ANC leaders, most of whom were serving life sentences, and allows them to speak freely, hoping that the ANC will abandon its use of violence. The ANC leaders speak in tones of moderation, emphasizing discipline, hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps, such as freeing Nelson Mandela, the most prominent ANC figure, and unbanning the organization.  The government of President F.W. de Klerk is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions. Meanwhile, the many organizations inside the country that back the ANC are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and mobilize their supporters even though the state of emergency, which has severely curtailed black opposition, remains in force.  The result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening. Six months ago, government approval for an ANC rally was inconceivable. Equally inconceivable is that the ANC, given the chance to hold a rally, would extend a hand, albeit warily, to the government. In a message read out at the rally, exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo, who can't legally be quoted in South Africa, said the country was at a crossroads and that Mr. de Klerk "may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country" if he chooses a "path of genuine political settlement."  Still, this doesn't mean that either the government or the ANC is changing stripes -- or that either has moved significantly closer to the other</example>

        <example>casting a pall over much of the junk market. Michael McNamara, director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services, says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer, contributing to the slide in prices.  "Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals," he says. "This year, at best, it's in one in every five or six. And our credit standards haven't changed one iota." However, Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating "one hell of a buying opportunity" for selective buyers.  For the moment, investors seem more preoccupied with the "bad" junk than the "good" junk. "The market has been weak since" the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company's subsequent bailout by Olympia &amp; York, says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch. "That really affected the market in that people started to ask 'What else is in trouble? '"  Well before Campeau, though, there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever. Despite the relatively strong economy, junk bond prices did nothing except go down, hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news:  -- In June, two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $1.2 billion of speculative debt securities, New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. said it ran out of borrowed money.  -- In July, Southmark Corp., the Dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $1.3 billion of junk bonds, voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law. -- By the end of July, the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points.  -- In August, Resorts International Inc., which sold more than $500 million of junk bonds, suspended interest payments.  -- In September, just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau, Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $1.2 billion of debt securities.  Meantime, regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating</example>

        <example>The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates (mainly employment or hours) instead of output estimates for those sectors, such as governments, paid household services and private non-profit institutions, where there are difficulties in assembling output data. This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor. In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees, it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s. Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector, this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year, on average.  The federal productivity estimators use labor input, rather than output, data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well. Independent estimates of output in those industries, including one by the Department of Labor for banking, suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5% a year between 1948 and 1988. Because finance and services contribute 10% to final business product, missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15% a year.  The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes. I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product.  Finally, the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services. In 1985, a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced, and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed. Since then, further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate.  In sum, the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP</example>
