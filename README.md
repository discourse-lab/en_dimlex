## Documentation

The structure of en_dimlex is based on the original [DiMLex German lexicon](https://github.com/discourse-lab/dimlex/blob/master/DimLex-documentation.md). Depending on the source of the entry (see the [paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5042) for details), the sense, usage example, frequency and syntactic information is automatically extracted or manually assigned.
